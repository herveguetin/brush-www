import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Let's use the Shopify Storefront API to retrieve market and language scoped product data.

## Backend code update
<Badge text='See commit "Product data with Storefront API"' variant="note" />

- Create an `/app` directory which contains our business logic.
- Add a `product-download.ts` file that that uses Brush-provided Storefront API client to make a GraphQL query.
- Store this query in a separate file to keep code clean and make sure to implement the `@inContext` to get localized data.  
- Update `tsconfig` files to ensure proper TypeScript linting.
