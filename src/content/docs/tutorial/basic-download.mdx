import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

We need to add the actual action on the "Download" button for each product.
Clicking on the button triggers an API GET request to the Gadget backend, which, for now, only returns a message with the requested product ID.

## Frontend code update
<Badge text='See commit "Download basics"' variant="tip" />

- Update the button of the grid product item in order to trigger the `downloadProductPdf` method of the Alpine component.
- The `downloadProductPdf` method calls the App Proxy base URL `/apps/brush` followed by the API endpoint `product-download` and the product ID as a parameter.
- For now, handling the response is just a matter of simple logging.

## Backend code update
<Badge text='See commit "Download GET route"' variant="note" />

- Create a GET route accepting the `id` request parameter.
- Send a very simple response to validate we properly get the product id from the frontend request.
